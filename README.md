Description of data file “Demographic_rescue_complete_dataset.csv” for the manuscript “Demographic rescue falters when pathogens are present” by Catherine L. Searle, Stephanie O. Gutierrez, Ilinca I. Ciubotariu, Alana López-Cruz, Mark R. Christie

Each of the below is a column heading and its description grouped by Experimental details and Response variables.

Experimental Details:

week = week in which samling occurred (where 1 = 7 days after the beginning of the experiment, 2 = 14 days after the beginning of the experiment etc.)

beaker.id = unique identifier for each replicate beaker (population) 

block = the block (timing) of a beaker (two blocks total)

beaker.num = a randomly generated value for the order that beakers were sampled each week 

treat.id = an indicator of the combined pathogen + rescue treatment. A = unexposed, no rescue, B = unexposed, low rescue, C = unexposed, high rescue, D = pathogen-exposed, no rescue, E = pathogen-exposed, low rescue, F = pathogen-exposed, high rescue

metsch.treat = pathogen (Metschnikowia bicuspidata) treatment. UN = unexposed to the pathogen. INF = exposed to the pathogen

sup.treat = rescue (supplementation) treatment: none, low or high



Response Variables: Values are the number of individuals in each category found in the 55mL subsample of the population on a given sampling day. 

ad.female = adult female

juv.female = juvenile female

ad.male = adult male

juv.male = juvenile male

ad.inf.female = infected adult female

juv.inf.female = infected juvenile female

ad.inf.male = infected adult male

juv.inf. male = infected juvenile male
